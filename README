Glitch Kittens is a small game created to help me learn pygame.
Instructions:
- Use WASD to move around
- Use E to activate 'boost', giving you 3x speed for 500 ticks, with a cooldown of 1000 ticks
- Use Q to activate 'slowdown;, making the game run slower for 100 ticks, with a cooldown of 2000 ticks
- Use R to teleport to a random position.
- Press ESC to quit
- Try to survive for as long as possible!

Modifiers:
- superfast (sf): runs the game at 1000 tps instead of 100
- superslow (ss): runs the game at 10 tps instead of 100
- debug (db): prints debug info to the console, which may cause the tps to drop
- bigglitches (bg): makes glitches 5x bigger
- massiveglitches (mg): makes glitches 10x bigger
- tinyglitches (tg): makes glitches 10x smaller
- extraglitch (eg): adds an extra glitch at the start of the game
- noplayer (np): removes the player, for some reason; please do not make this your screensaver
- randomteleport (rt): has a chance of randomly teleporting the player
