Glitch Kittens is a small game created to help me learn pygame.
Instructions:
- Use WASD to move around
- Use E to activate 'boost', giving you 5x speed
- Use Q to activate 'slowdown;, making the game run slower
- Use R to teleport to a random position
- Press ESC to oen the pause menu
- In the pause menu, use W, S, and SPACE to navigate
- Try to survive for as long as possible!

Modifiers:
- superfast (sf): runs the game at 1000 tps instead of 100
- ultrafast (uf): runs the game at unlimited tps
- superslow (ss): runs the game at 10 tps instead of 100

- tinyglitches (tg): makes glitches 10x smaller
- extraglitch (eg): adds an extra glitch at the start of the game
